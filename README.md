# Mercator Service

REST-based HTTP service for Mercator.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Building from sources

To build this project, you will need to run the following:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Installation

To install the software on the system, after checking out the
dependencies you can use:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

In order to configure the behavior of the service, there is couple of
environment variables, in bold their default values:

* `RUST_LOG` = `info`:

   Set the level of logging, for example (**error**, **warn**, **info**,
   **debug**, **trace**). This can be controlled per subsystem of the
   service, or globally by specifying th subsystem and the level in a
   list, or omitting the subsystem part.

   For example:

   ```sh
   # Set actix_web to debug, mercator_service to trace,
   # fall back to info for everything else:
   RUST_LOG="info,actix_web=debug,mercator_service=trace"

   # Set everything to trace
   RUST_LOG="trace"
   ```

   [More details](https://epfl-dias.github.io/mercator_service/env_logger/index.html)
   on how to control the logs.

* `MERCATOR_HOST` = **0.0.0.0** :

   Name or IP address to bind to.

* `MERCATOR_PORT` = **8888** :

   Port on which to listen.

* `MERCATOR_BASE` = **/spatial-search** :

   Web service URL prefix.

* `MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` = **http://localhost:3200** :

   Allowed origins for CORS requests.

* `MERCATOR_DATA` = **.**:

   Provide the root folder of the data sets to expose.

### Example

```sh
RUST_LOG="warn,actix_web=info,mercator_service=trace" \
    MERCATOR_HOST="mercator.example.org" \
    MERCATOR_PORT="1234" \
    MERCATOR_BASE="/" \
    MERCATOR_DATA="../mercator_indexer" \
    MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3200,http://localhost:3201, http://localhost:3202" \
    mercator_service
```

## Documentation

### User documentation

By this, we mean the REST API documentation. To access it and be able
to test it live you can use the following procedure:

 1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com).
 2. Start mercator_service, making sure there is the `static` folder,
    or a symlink to it, in the current working directory.
 3. Start swagger to have access to the live documentation:

    ```sh
    docker run \
        --rm \
        -p 3200:8080 \
        -e API_URL='http://127.0.0.1:8888/spatial-search/static/api/v1.0.yaml' \
        swaggerapi/swagger-ui
    ```

 4. Using your web navigator, got to [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200).
 5. You have the whole user documentation accessible, and you can
    trigger actions on your live mercator_service instance, running
    queries on your data.

Otherwise you can read `static/api/v1.0.yaml` directly.

### Developer documentation

For people looking at the internal structure, you can use the
[developer documentation](https://epfl-dias.github.io/mercator_service/).

If you want to build this documentation and access it locally, you can
use:

```sh
cargo doc --open
```
