# Mercator Service

REST-based HTTP service for Mercator.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Hardware

 * **Processor:** XGHz CPU
 * **RAM:** Y MB per MB of indexed data
 * **Available storage space:** X MB per MB of indexed data

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick start

## Building from sources

To build this project, you will need to run the following:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Installation

To install the software on the system you can use:

```sh
cargo install --release
```

### Usage

In order to configure the behavior of the service, there is couple of environment variables:

* `RUST_LOG`: Set the level of logging, for example (**error**, **warn**, **info**, **debug**, **trace**). This can be controlled per subsystem of the service, or globally by specifying th subsystem and the level in a list, or omitting the subsystem part. For example:
  ```sh
  RUST_LOG="actix_web=debug,mercator_service=trace" # Set actix_web to debug, mercator_service to trace
  RUST_LOG="trace" # Set everything to trace
  ```

* `MERCATOR_HOST`: Name or IP address to bind to.
* `MERCATOR_PORT`: Port on which to listen.
* `MERCATOR_BASE`: Prefix du service web.
* `MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Allowed origins for CORS requests:
  ```sh
  MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3200,http://localhost:3201, http://localhost:3202"
  ```

* `MERCATOR_IMPORT_DATA`: Provide the data set to expose.

Complete example of a run:
```sh
RUST_LOG="warn,actix_web=info,mercator_service=trace" MERCATOR_IMPORT_DATA="1000k" MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3200,http://localhost:3201, http://localhost:3202" cargo run --release
```
